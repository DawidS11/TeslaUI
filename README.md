This program creates a UI similar to the one on Tesla's tablet. It does have some basic features changed via interaction:
- map with location set to Valencia, Spain
- navigation search bar
- lock/unlock icon (changed via mouse click)
- current time
- recording icon (changed via mouse click)
- indoor temperature for a driver and a passenger (set via clicks on the arrows next to the icons)
- speakers' volume (set via clicks on the arrows next to the icon)

It has been created using QML and C++/Qt. Icons downloaded from flaticon.com.
